        <p>Social media triggers sadness through social isolation. It becomes addictive and when stopping excessive user, it has psychological effects that start causing physiological changes. There is less satisfaction with day to day life because social media is not concerned with well-being. People have an increased feeling of social isolation which is not healthy from a mental standpoint. Social media revolves around social acceptance. People feel they must post their life and get approval from others through comments and likes. It is discouraging to get less likes and comments on new posts. People’s ego changes when they get more likes because they have a mentality of being popular. Those who don’t get that attention, seek it. They compare themselves to others, creating negative impacts on their mental health and self confidence. Users post provocative pictures to try and get likes or show off their body. It has become a social norm to look a certain way because that is what gets the most attention and the most likes.</p>


      <p>Social media can set unrealistic standards and it’s not as easy to see because the people being compared are peers not just celebrities. Instagram and facebook shows mainly the high points of people’s life and not the struggles/hard times creating a false image of what people’s lives are really like. Children who use social media, use it for validation and compare themselves to their peers to gauge their status. It makes people feel like everyone but them has their life put together. This explains the increase in depression, anxiety, and other related mental illnesses since the release of smartphone technology.

      <p>Sherry Turkle discusses the roots of social isolation in her Ted Talk. She says that technology makes us want connection over conversation. People would rather text than talk in a real conversation. This is devastating for our future generations because not learning to have good conversational skills will hurt our ability to connect and form real relationships with others. Phone users think it is easier to be on their phones than talk and interactive people because of the control that our phones make us feel we have. They have emotional design that triggers constant attention and fulfills the parts of people that are most vulnerable. This includes loneliness, connection, and someone to listen to them. People feel their phones are listening to them and that being on social media is the only way to have a automatic audience to fill that void of having their voice be heard. In turn, society has become socially isolated. Friends may meet up together, but they are glued to their phones. They are not really present in the moment, building real relationships. They are obsessed with the ability to control their attention and feel like they are escaping to multiple places at once with the help of social media.</p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>I am afraid of the increasing effects this media has on generations to come because it continues to flourish and become such a large influence. People begin to live their lives through it, instead of actually interacting with people in person. While we may feel we control technology, it is actually controlling us.
