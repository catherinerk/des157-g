    <h1>Comparative Analysis</h1>
    <p>I wanted to choose these websites because they are completely opposite of each other. One is a beauty website for waxing and nails and the other is about how society needs to look beyond beauty and look at the corruption that still exists. Both websites have beautiful interactive interfaces.

        <h2>Cure</h2>
        <img src = "images/cure1.png" alt = "cure">
        <p>The cure nails/waxing website uses high resolution images to capture the clean aesthetic they are aiming for to represent the cleanliness of their services. The way the images glide in from the multiple sides of the pages is very visually appealing. Their target audience is definitely females because they use female models in all their pictures. The color scheme is also very dainty because they use a lot of tints and warm colors. The fonts they use are also very playful and the brand name follows as you scroll down the page. There is a lot of emotional design that went into this site as well because the images are taken at weird perspectives and the facial expression of the models is very pronounced. Although the models are wearing makeup, there is still a natural essence to them. They went for an organic look and feel because they pride themselves in using only organic skin products. They also have a lot of models posing with fruit to make the products look more natural. The hover features of this site are also very entertaining. The art that is used behind the images gives the site an artsy and playful touch and makes you want to continue scrolling. The icons they created are very delicate but beautiful because they are line with no fill. This is a style I love using and looking at. The layout is also simple because the nav bar at the top only has 3 categories and then you can click more on the side and scroll down to discover products and booking for appointments.</p>

      <h2>Beyond Beauty</h2>
      <img src = "images/beyond1.png" alt = "beyond">
      <p>The beyond-beauty website is about how these four female celebrities care more than just beauty because often in the media they are objectified and not seen as people with morals and passions. The site features Jennifer Lawrence, Natalie Portman, Emma Watson, and Cara Delevingne. There is also large dramatic font that gives the user a hint about what the celebrities’ story is about. The simplicity of the site makes it clear what the goals of the creator are. The mouse itself is interactive because it tells the user what to do, to drag, learn more. The motivates the user to want to figure out what the website is about. I’ve always hated reading so I was very impressed when I clicked on the celebrity, their speak was being read aloud and the words that were said were highlighted right after so I could easily read along. They all talked about things that were important to me and a lot of women. These topics included female sexuality, free to be sensitive, change of corruption, and the idea we are living in a fantasy. The site evokes a decent amount of emotion because it is black and white with subtle pops of color and then hearing the celebrities voice their opinion on the current issues of our society appeals to pathos. It almost makes you want to try and make an impact because at the bottom there is a timeline of everything these celebrities have done to try to help the issues they care about. They stand and act for the greater good even though they are mostly known for their beauty. The two sides are very different but both touch on the idea of female sexuality and beauty that is a fantasy.  Overall, this site has strong user interaction and interface design to convey their message.
